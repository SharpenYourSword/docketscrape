# docketscrape
This is a program that scrapes individual Missouri Case.net dockets to see if there have been any updates to the docket. 

In this example, I'm using case #14BA-CV01093, Leigh Britt v. the Curators of the University of Missouri. 

To apply the program to a different case, simply insert the case number into the url string:

https://www.courts.mo.gov/casenet/cases/searchDockets.do?inputVO.caseNumber=14BA-CV01093&inputVO.courtId=CT13

The program can be run through the terminal. It will print the number of entries from the previous day and the number of entries from the current day, as well as a message indicating whether there are new entries.
